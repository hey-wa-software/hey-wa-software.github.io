        <p>
            When you browse the LinkedIn web site as a signed-in user,
            your name and photo can appear one or more times on each
            LinkedIn web page.
        </p>
        <p>
            A stranger passing nearby who sees your computer screen, or
            someone viewing a screen capture of a LinkedIn web page that you
            might have shared publicly, might be able to figure out who you
            are.
        </p>
        <p>
            The extension offers you some privacy under those
            circumstances by giving you the ability to obscure your name
            and photos while you browse the LinkedIn web site. To choose
            which information to obscure, visit the <icon>⚙️</icon> Settings page.

                        Open the browser's DevTools (development tools)
                        window by doing any one of the following.

                                then choose "More tools", then choose
                                "Developer tools".</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Switch to the "Application" tab in the
                        horizontal menu at the top of the DevTools
                        window.</li>
                    <li>In the list on the left, under the heading
                        "Storage", find "Extension storage".</li>
                    <li>Expand "Extension storage" by
                        double-clicking it or single-clicking its
                        "▶️" (rightward-pointing) arrow.</li>
                    <li>Find and expand the extension's name to
                        reveal four new items below it: Session,
                        Local, Sync, and Managed.</li>
                    <li>Click any of these four names to learn where
                        the extension stores your data, but
                        you'll find that it only uses "Local".</li>
                    <li>If you wish to change or remove any of this
                        data, you can right-click on it and choose
                        "Edit" or "Delete".</li>
                    <li>To delete all of the extension's data,
                        remove the extension from your browser.
                        If you've installed the extension on multiple
                        browsers and/or multiple computers, you will have
                        to uninstall the extension from each of them.
