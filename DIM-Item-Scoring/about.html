    <h2><a name="what">What is this?</a></h2>

    <p>
        It is a browser extension designed to add information I find useful to
        <a href="https://destinyitemmanager.com/">
            DIM (Destiny Item Manager)
        </a>.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="why">What is it for?</a></h2>

    <p>
        When comparing weapons in DIM, this extension helped me quickly identify which one was "best".
    </p>

    <p>
        When comparing two or more weapons, this extension reads each weapon's stats to calculate a score, displays that
        score below each weapon's name, and lets you sort the weapons by their score. The "best" score is shown in cyan
        as
        "1.000" and the numbers get smaller and redder from there.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="appearance">What does it look like?</a></h2>

    <p>
        It updates DIM's "Compare Items" UI (the part circled in green in the screenshot).
    </p>

    <div>
        <a href="./compare-drawer.png"><img src="./compare-drawer.png"></a>
    </div>

    <p>
        To something like this:
    </p>

    <table style="text-align: center;">
        <tr>
            <th>Before</th>
            <th>After</th>
        </tr>
        <tr style="vertical-align: top;">
            <td>
                <a href="./before.png"><img src="./before.png" /></a>
            </td>
            <td>
                <a href="./after.png"><img src="./after.png" /></a>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        See the green rectangle in the screenshot below? That's where the new stat appears, near the top between the
        name and the Power stat.
    </p>

    <p>
        For Combat Bows, the name of this stat is "ARROWS!"
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="./after-with-score-row-highlighted.png"><img src="./after-with-score-row-highlighted.png" /></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        See what names are given to other weapon types!
    </p>

    <h2><a name="motivation">What inspired this extension?</a></h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            I wanted to see a DPS (damage per second) stat that could be calculated using a formula that
            includes Impact and RPM, so I opened the browser's debug console and experimented with some loose JavaScript
            that updated DIM's Compare Items table.
        </li>
        <li>
            Encouraged by the success of this custom DPS stat, I was encouraged to also roll up other interesting weapon
            stats like Reload Speed and Aim Assist so that I didn't have to do the calculations in my head.
        </li>
        <li>
            But I got tired of repeatedly opening the browser's debug console to manually execute the custom JavaScript
            every time I opened the Compare Items UI.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="how">How does it work?</a></h2>

    <p>
        Prerequisite:
        The "Compare Items" UI must be open and there must be more than one weapon in it.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            The type of weapons being compared is determined (e.g. "Combat Bow", "Grenade Launcher").
        </li>
        <li>
            The extension looks up the formula appropriate for this weapon type.
        </li>
        <li>
            The formula specifies how to calculate a weapon's score as a combination of its stats. (See example below.)
        </li>
        <li>
            The score for each weapon is calculated, normalized to betwen 0.000 and 1.000, colored from cyan (best) to
            red (worst), and then displayed in a new, sortable row of numbers underneath the weapon names.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name"exampleFormula">Example weapon score formula</a></h3>

    <p>
        <a href="./formula-tooltip.png"><img src="./formula-tooltip.png" /></a>
        In this screenshot we see a tooltip showing that the Hand Cannon formula is calculated as
        (RPM ❌ Impact ❌ Range ❌ Stability ❌ Reload ❌ Aim ❌ Magazine) ➗ (Handling ❌ Zoom).
        The tooltip appears when you hover over the score row's name, in this case "BANG!".
    </p>
    <p>
        This Hand Cannon formula is derived from my play style, which prefers stats like RPM, Impact, and Stability to
        be bigger and stats like Handling and Zoom to be smaller.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, Crimson's score is overwhelming because of its high RPM stat.
    </p>
    <p>
        ℹ️ ProTip: If you don't like how a weapon is skewing the results, you can remove it from the comparison.
        The remaining scores will be automatically recalculated and there will be a new "best" among them.
    </p>
    <p>
        For those of you who disagree with any of the formulas, or would like more control over them, please <a
            href="../Contact/">
            let me know
        </a> if I should prioritize letting you customize the formulas over adding support for armor or other
        inventory item types.
    </p>

        <dd>
            <p>
                Hover over the row name to read the formula in a tooltip.

        </dd>

        <dd>
            <p>
                The scores will recalculate soon after any changes.
            </p>
        </dd>

        <dd>
            <p>
                If for any reason a weapon's stats change, and that stat is included in the weapon's scoring formula,
                then this extension will automatically recalculate a weapon's score shortly after DIM becomes aware of
                those changes. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You change the "Assume Masterworked" toggle</li>
                <li>You preview a perk change in DIM's "Compare Items" UI</li>
                <li>You apply a perk change to the weapon in DIM</li>
                <li>You apply a perk change to the weapon in-game (and wait for DIM to receive the update from Bungie)
                </li>
                <li>You increase the weapon's masterworking tier</li>
                <li>You raise the Power level of the weapon through infusion (if the weapon's formula includes the Power
                    stat, which it doesn't by default)</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>

                My biggest time sink in DIM was comparing weapons, so I solved that problem first.

        <dd>
            <p>
                To draw my attention to underleveled weapons that deserve to be infused.
                If you want to sort by Power, you can always click on the word "Power".
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt><a name="no-perks-in-formulas">Why don't the formulas include weapon perks?</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                If a perk permanently affects one or more stat numbers (e.g. "+1 Magazine", "-10 Stability"),
                and the formula includes that stat, and that perk is selected,
                then the score will reflect that.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a perk only affects one or more stat numbers as a result of how you play
                (e.g. "Feeding Frenzy - Each rapid kill with this weapon progressively increases reload speed for a short time."),
                then that is impossible to account for outside of the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short, this extension doesn't read the perks for each weapon,
                and therefore doesn't take their effects into account -- unless,
                as mentioned above, they affect the weapon's stats immediately.

            <p>
                In <a href="https://app.destinyitemmanager.com/whats-new">update 8.67.0</a>,
                DIM changed how it renders the HTML.  My code just messes with the HTML and
                CSS elements after DIM renders them to your browser; it doesn't change DIM's code,
                so the two don't play nice sometimes, sorry.
            </p>
            <p>
                You'll see this visual corruption when sorting the items by other stats,
                or by adding or removing items.  If the corruption doesn't go away by itself
                after a few seconds, then just close and reopen the Compare Items UI.
            </p>
