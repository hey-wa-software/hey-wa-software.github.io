        An effective bug report will contain enough information to help me find and fix the problem that you encountered.

    <p>
        Including as much of the following information as you can is helpful, the more the better:

        <dd>
            How to encounter the problem.
            Pretend that you're writing a recipe; describe how you used the software step by step to reveal the problem.
        </dd>
        <dt>Actual Behavior</dt>
        <dd>
            Describe what went wrong as a result of following your recipe.
