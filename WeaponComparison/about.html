    <h2><a name="what">What is this?</a></h2>

    <p>
        It is a browser extension designed to add information I find useful to
        <a href="https://destinyitemmanager.com/">
            DIM (Destiny Item Manager)
        </a>.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="why">What is it for?</a></h2>

    <p>
        When comparing weapons in DIM, this extension helped me quickly identify which one was "best".
    </p>

    <p>
        When comparing two or more weapons, this extension reads each weapon's stats to calculate a score, displays that
        score below each weapon's name, and lets you sort this new row of numbers. The "best" score is shown in cyan as
        "1.000" and the numbers get smaller and redder from there.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="appearance">What does it look like?</a></h2>

    <p>
        It updates DIM's "Compare Items" UI (the part circled in green in the screenshot).
    </p>

    <div>
        <a href="./compare-drawer.png"><img src="./compare-drawer.png"></a>
    </div>

    <p>
        To something like this:
    </p>

    <table style="text-align: center;">
        <tr>
            <th>Before</th>
            <th>After</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <a href="./Before.png"><img style="width: 75%;" src="./Before.png" /></a>
            </td>
            <td>
                <a href="./After.png"><img style="width: 75%;" src="./After.png" /></a>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        See the green rectangle in the screenshot below? That's where the new stat appears, near the top between the
        name
        and the Power stat.
    </p>

    <p>
        For Combat Bows, the name of this stat is "ARROWS!"
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>
        See what names are given to other weapon types!
    </p>

    <h2><a name="motivation">What inspired this extension?</a></h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            I wanted to see a DPS (damage per second) stat that could be calculated using a formula that
            includes Impact and RPM, so I opened the browser's debug console and experimented with some loose JavaScript
            that updated DIM's Compare Items table.
        </li>
        <li>
            Encouraged by the success of this custom DPS stat, I was encouraged to also roll up other interesting weapon
            stats like Reload Speed and Aim Assist so that I didn't have to do the calculations in my head.
        </li>
        <li>
            But I got tired of repeatedly opening the browser's debug console to manually execute the custom JavaScript
            every time I opened the Compare Items UI.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="how">How does it work?</a></h2>

    <p>
        Prerequisite:
        The "Compare Items" UI must be open and there must be more than one weapon in it.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            The type of weapons being compared is determined (e.g. "Combat Bow", "Grenade Launcher").
        </li>
        <li>
            The extension looks up the formula appropriate for this weapon type.
        </li>
        <li>
            The formula specifies how to calculate a weapon's score as a combination of its stats. (See example below.)
        </li>
        <li>
            The score for each weapon is calculated, normalized to betwen 0.000 and 1.000, colored from cyan (best) to
            red (worst), and then displayed in a new, sortable row of numbers underneath the weapon names.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name"exampleFormula">Example weapon score formula</a></h3>

    <p>
        <a href="./formula-tooltip.png"><img src="./formula-tooltip.png" /></a>
        In this screenshot we see a tooltip showing that the Hand Cannon formula is calculated as
        (RPM ❌ Impact ❌ Range ❌ Stability ❌ Reload ❌ Aim ❌ Magazine) ➗ (Handling ❌ Zoom).
        The tooltip appears when you hover over the score row's name, in this case "BANG!".
    </p>
    <p>
        This Hand Cannon formula is derived from my play style, which prefers stats like RPM, Impact, and Stability to
        be bigger and stats like Handling and Zoom to be smaller.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, Crimson's score is overwhelming because of its high RPM stat.
    </p>
    <p>
        ℹ️ ProTip: If a weapon is skewing the results, you can remove it. The remaining scores will be
        automatically recalculated and there will be a new "best" among them.
    </p>
    <p>
        For those of you who disagree with any of the formulas, or would like more control over them, please <a
            href="../Contact/">
            let me know
        </a> if I should prioritize letting you customize the formulas over adding support for armor or other
        inventory item types.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="interacting">What can I do with the scores?</a></h2>

    <dl>
        <dt>Sort them</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                Click on the row name to sort weapons by their scores. Click again to change the sort order.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Learn what the scoring formula is</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                Hover over the row name to read the formula in a tooltip.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Add or remove weapons to the list</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                The scores will recalculate soon after any changes.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>See how changing the perks affects the score</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                If you preview a change by clicking on a perk in DIM, or permanently change a weapon's perks in DIM or
                in-game, its score will automatically update shortly after DIM updates.
            </p>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2><a name="known-issues">Known issues</a></h2>

    <dl>
        <dt>Can I customize the formulas?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                Not as of April 2025, but please <a href="../Contact/">let me know</a> if I should prioritize letting
                you do that, or invite you to send me a pull request if you add that feature yourself.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Why don't the formulas include the Power stat?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                To draw my attention to underleveled weapons that deserved to be infused.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Why isn't armor scored?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                My biggest time sink in DIM was comparing weapons, so I solved that problem first.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Where's the &gt; or &lt; arrow that shows which direction the scores are sorted?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                DIM uses an SVG to draw that arrow and I haven't learned how to do SVGs yet, sorry.
                Also, my code assumes the arrow isn't there, so adding the arrow would break my fragile code.
                Also, why not just click the row name a few
                more times until you figure out which way it's sorted?
            </p>
        </dd>
